# Flou
supercollider codes for the sounds of the performance Flou from Ieltxu Ortueta

from the performance's release:

Sound and music in FLOU are the dimension that connects the designer to the drawing. The music moves the body and the movement becomes drawing, or is it the reverse? The drawing and the paper have life of their own and express themselves through sound. Does it create is to give life to something that already exists? A dialogue between creator and creation (creature?) is settled. It is even possible that at some point and uncertain measure these roles are exchanged. The sounds translate the drawings to the sounding dimension. Breathe, draw, claim, and are expressed from algorithms that reproduce the way of randomness with which drawings are formed.
